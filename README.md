Binary File Processing with Python

This project provides a Python script to read, interpret, and process binary files according to a specific file structure. The code handles binary files with a specific header and record structure. It calculates the total credit amount, total debit amount, and balance for each user ID present in the file.
File Structure

The binary file (Big Endian) has the following structure:

    Header:
        4 byte string 
        1 byte version
        4 byte (uint32) number of records

    Record:
        1 byte record type enum (0x00: Debit, 0x01: Credit, 0x02: StartAutopay, 0x03: EndAutopay)
        4 byte (uint32) Unix timestamp
        8 byte (uint64) user ID
        If the record type is Debit or Credit, there is an additional field: an 8 byte (float64) amount in dollars at the end of the record

Usage

The primary function to use is read_process_binary_file(binary_file_name), which reads and processes the binary file.

Here's how to use it:

python

result = read_process_binary_file('your_file_name')

This will return a dictionary with total debit amount, total credit amount, and balance, each rounded to two decimal places.
Dependencies

This script uses Python's built-in struct module to handle the binary data.
